## What the course will look like

We will work together through developing a package, and at various steps along the way we will take detours to examine tools, processes, and package structure.

The tools we'll be using (RStudio + devtools, usethis, and friends) are designed to 'get out of the way' and enable a workflow that helps you focus on the code you are writing.
We'll be live coding together, and emphasizing these workflows and processes.

The core ideas in this course are taken from the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org) book [@wickham2023r] by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan, now in its second edition.
We basically follow the format of the "Whole Game" chapter, stepping through the key steps in making a package, with detours along the way to explore the main concepts in a bit more detail.

### Sticky notes

We will be using sticky notes to make sure everyone is getting what they need out of the course.
Everyone will get two sticky notes of different colours (e.g., one red, one green) that we use as status flags.
If someone has completed an exercise they put the green sticky note on their laptop; if they run into a problem and need help, put up the red one.

### TAs

TBD

### Note-taking

We will be using a private Discord channel for note-taking during the course.
You will be given access before the workshop.
